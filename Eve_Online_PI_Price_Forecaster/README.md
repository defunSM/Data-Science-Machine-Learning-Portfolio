Eve Online Price Forecaster
==============================

In Eve Online, raw materials can be extracted from planets. These raw materials are then refined into various refined goods often sold in the markets. 
This project is an attempt to use machine learning techniques to try to predict/forcast the future price of these goods. Ultimately to decide which raw materials players should invest time in extracting and when to sell for the most profit as players sell in bulk. We will also try to see if there are any arbitrage opportunities, aka someone is buying for higher than what someone is selling between different markets.

# 1. Setup Instructions
    1. run `make requirements` to install dependencies from requirements.txt and set up environment
    2. create .env file and store DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_NAME,DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD, DATABASE_PORT for Postgresql database.
    3. run `make update && make collection` to run collect_data.py which will store the JSON data into the database.
