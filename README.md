## Projects

[**Disaster Response Classification**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/Diasaster%20Response%20Classification) - Text messages as input to a **Multi-Label** classification model to identify the diasaster category. Built a ETL and ML pipeline to process **class imbalanced** data from [Appen](https://appen.com/) and *improved f1-score* of model using **undersampling**. 

[**Starbucks Promotional Analysis**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/Starbucks_Promotion_Analysis) - Analysis of Starbucks Promotional data using **hypothesis testing**. Developing an **optimal promotional strategy** by training a model based on the promotional data.

[**NYC Salary Growth Predicator**](https://github.com/defunSM/NYC-Salary-Predictor) - Created model to predict salary based on title description and forcast expected growth of a job to help inform NYC budget. Exploratory Data Analysis of the data set from [OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). 

[**NYC Airbnb**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/NYC_Airbnb/NYC_airbnb.ipynb) - Identifying most valuable property assets and strategies for maximizing profits for property owners in NYC from a NYC airbnb Dataset.
