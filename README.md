## Projects

[**Disaster Response Classification**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/Diasaster%20Response%20Classification) - Text messages to created a model to do **Multi-Label** classification of the diasaster category. Built a ETL and ML pipeline to process **class imbalanced** data from [Appen](https://appen.com/) and *improved f1-score* of model using **undersampling**. 

[**NYC Salary Growth Predicator**](https://github.com/defunSM/NYC-Salary-Predictor) - Created model to predict Salary based on title description and forcast expected growth of a job to help inform NYC budget. Exploratory Data Analysis of the data set from [OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). 

[**NYC Airbnb**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/NYC_Airbnb/NYC_airbnb.ipynb) - Identifying most valuable property assets and strategies for maximizing profits for property owners in NYC from a NYC airbnb Dataset. 

[**HR Analytics**](https://github.com/defunSM/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/HR_Analytics) - Building a model in order for HR to make informed decisions on turnover rates.
