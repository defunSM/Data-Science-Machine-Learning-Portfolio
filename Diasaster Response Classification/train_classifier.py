    Splits the dataset into training and test sets
    Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
    Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
    Outputs results on the test set
    Exports the final model as a pickle file
    
    Example Usage: python train_classifier.py ../data/DisasterResponse.db classifier.pkl
